It seems like you want a step-by-step explanation of how to deploy a React app and set up a GitHub repository for the provided code. Here's a detailed guide:

1. Create a React App: If you haven't already done so, create a new React app using Create React App. Run the following command in your terminal:

   
   npx create-react-app zomato-recommends


2. Navigate to the Project Directory: Change your current directory to the newly created project directory:

 
   cd zomato-recommends


3. Replace src/App.js: Replace the contents of `src/App.js` with the provided code for the Zomato Recommends component.

4. Install Axios: Axios is a library for making HTTP requests in JavaScript. Install it using npm or yarn:

   
   npm install axios
   

   or


   yarn add axios


5. Create a GitHub Repository: Go to GitHub and create a new repository named `zomato-recommends`. Follow the instructions provided by GitHub to initialize the repository.

6. Commit and Push Code: Initialize a Git repository in your project directory, add all files, commit your changes, and push to the GitHub repository:

  
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin <https://github.com/harishsreddy6/zomato>
   git push -u origin main


  

7. **Deploy to Hosting Provider: You can deploy your React app to a hosting provider like Netlify or Vercel. Here's how to deploy to Netlify:

   - Sign up for a Netlify account if you haven't already.
   - Once logged in, click on "New site from Git".
   - Connect your GitHub repository.
   - Configure the build settings (usually defaults work fine for Create React App).
   - Click "Deploy site".

By following these steps, you'll have deployed your React app to a hosting provider and set up a GitHub repository containing the code.
